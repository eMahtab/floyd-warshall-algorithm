# Floyd Warshall Algorithm
Floyd Warshall algorithm is used to find the shortest ath from any vertex to any other vertex in a weighted graph.

## Algorithm:
1. Create a 2D array `matrix` of n * n , where n is the number of vertices in the weighted graph
2. Initialize the 2D array `matrix[i][i] = 0` and all other cells as `matrix[i][j] = Integer.MAX_VALUE (some higher value)`
3.
